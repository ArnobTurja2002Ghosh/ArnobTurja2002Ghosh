# How to pronounce my name

Now if you are a Bengali, you have probably already guessed the Bengali transliteration for my name: অর্ণব (yes, that is how I write my name in Bengali).
But since Bengali itself is non-phonetical language, are you sure you know the pronunciation of my name? How much sure?
Sorry, just messing with you, I am pretty sure you know how to pronounce this common Bengali name if you are a Bengali, but you can now probably smell my interest in liguistics and phonetics apart from my interest in Computer Science and here I am going to display this interest by the theme of pronunciation of my name.

There was a sort of controversy about if Bengali language had derived from Sanskrit or if it had only been influenced by Sanskrit alongside many other languages. 
Now, keeping aside the controversy, there is no doubt that my name particularly derived from the Classical Sanskrit word अर्णव "Arnava", which derived from the Vedic Sanskrit word अ॑र्ण॒व "Arnava". 
I know, only the first three English letters of my name matches with the Classical Sanskrit word. Even the number of letters in the two words do not match (5 vs 6).
Therefore, time to break my name into the five letters.

## A
The अ in Devanagari alphabet may look similar to অ in Bengali alphabet, but they are very different in pronunciation.
According to John Beames, "अ is pronounced in Sanskrit and in nearly all the modern Indian languages as a short dull sound similar to the u in English sun, but, or to the a in woman. In Bengali, however, অ has a sound very nearly the same as the short o in English not, rock, top."
Look at the amount of confusion in the very first letter of the name! One particular sound that can be produced from "a", "u" and "o" of the English alphabet!
This is where ISO-15919 gives me the confidence in the spelling of my name - both the अ and অ are romanized to "a" - so I know I am not spelling it illogically to how it is pronounced - this is an international standard of transliteration.

## R

## N
Supposed to be a retroflex nasal (ɳ) for the letter ণ but in modern Bengali it is almost always pronounced the same as ন (n) according to the [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengali_alphabet#cite_ref-30)
## O
The sound contributed by this letter is called schwa. There was a consonant cluster of "R" and "N" before this. 
In Bengali language a consonant cluster usually follows a close-mid back rounded vowel (o), and my name is no exception.
Just like that the fourth letter of my name failed to match the fourth letter in the transliterated Sanskrit word.

## B
This is the letter that replaces the "va" in "Arnava"; but why is one letter replacing two letters and why "b" instead of "v"?

The answer to the first question is schwa deletion in Indo-Aryan languages. Hindi and Bengali are examples of Indo-Aryan languages.
Although the Devanagari script is used as a standard to write Modern Hindi, the schwa ('ə') implicit in each consonant of the script is "obligatorily deleted" at the end of words and in certain other contexts, unlike in Sanskrit. Since व is at the end of the word, Sanskrit would transliterate my name as "Arnava", but Hindi would transliterate it as "Arnav", resulting in a five-lettered name instead of six. But here's the thing: Hindi would use "v" to show the व because among the 26 letters of the English alphabet, the sound of "v" is the closest to "व". Notice that I said "closest"? That is because English uses voiced labiodental fricative to pronounce "v" and labial velar approximant to pronounce "w", but "व" is between those two sounds:  voiced labiodental approximant (ʋ). 

Now coming to Bengali, the language has a letter that has the sound of ʋ of IPA, but the letter appears twice in the Bengali alphabet, each time denoting a different sound. 
From "A Grammar Of The Bengal Language" by Nathaniel Brassey Halhed, I quote, "ব wo, in the Shanſcrit language is always uſed with the ſound of w; but in the Bengaleſe it is never diſtinguiſhed from ব bo either in form or utterance." That book was written in 18th century, which you could probably guess yourself from the letter "ſ" called "long s", so Halhed did not have access to the IPA devised in the 19th century. So decoding the above quote, by "wo in the Shanſcrit language" he probably meant about व of Sanskrit and ʋ of IPA. By "the Bengaleſe" he must mean about the Bengali language. So he is saying that there are two ব letters in the Bengali alphabet but both are formed and uttered in the same way - uttering the "b" sound. 
Let us see if 19th century could see any change here and here I would like to call John Beames with his "Grammar of the Bengali language literary and colloquial". He writes, "ব representing b (Sanskrit ब), and ব representing ʋ (Sanskrit व) are not distinguished in Bengali. It takes a Bengali boy many years of training before he can pronounce the English ʋ, and many never attain to it. Both as initial and medial ব is in Bengali always b..." (page 9). 

That answers the second question: "b" instead of "v" simply because Bengalis would not be able to pronounce the "v" properly - they would either pronounce the "v" of IPA or go as far as pronouncing "bh".
