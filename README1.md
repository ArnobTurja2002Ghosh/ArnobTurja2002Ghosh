# How to pronounce my name

Now if you are a Bengali, you have probably already guessed the Bengali transliteration for my name: অর্ণব (yes, that is how I write my name in Bengali).
But since Bengali itself is non-phonetical language, are you sure you know the pronunciation of my name? How much sure?
Sorry, just messing with you, I am pretty sure you know how to pronounce this common Bengali name if you are a Bengali, but you can now probably smell my interest in liguistics and phonetics apart from my interest in Computer Science and here I am going to display this interest by the theme of pronunciation of my name.

There was a sort of controversy about if Bengali language had derived from Sanskrit or if it had only been influenced by Sanskrit alongside many other languages. 
Now, keeping aside the controversy, there is no doubt that my name particularly derived from the Sanskrit word अर्णव "Arnava".
I know, only the first three letters of my name matches with that word. Even the number of letters in the two words do not match (5 vs 6).
Therefore, time to break my name into the five letters.

## A
The sound contributed by this letter is called schwa. In Sanskrit, the letter representing the sound is अ (ə). Bengali language does not have this sound, so instead it uses open-mid back rounded vowel (ɔ).
In English, any vowel can give the schwa. So why particularly "A" to denote schwa? Seriously, no reason: just a random English vowel to mark a schwa: or maybe not quite random if you think about the fact that "A" is literally the first letter and the first vowel of the English alphabet.

## R

## N
Supposed to be a retroflex nasal (ɳ) but since Bengali language does not have that sound it would use (n). 
I guess English language is similar to Bengali in this way that it does not care much about the difference between "ɳ" and "n", and prefers using "n" sound.
## O
The sound contributed by this letter is called schwa but why is it different from the first schwa in my name? Because there was a consonant cluster of "R" and "N" before this. 
In Bengali language a consonant cluster usually follows a close-mid back rounded vowel (o), and my name is no exception.
Just like that the fourth letter of my name failed to match the fourth letter in the transliterated Sanskrit word.

## B
