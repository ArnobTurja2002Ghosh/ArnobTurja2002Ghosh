## Water of the Firmament - Sea of Heaven
I read two versions of Rigveda 8.26 - one translated by H.H. Wilson and another by T.H. Griffith. One verse interested me more than the others in the hymn; no, not 8.26.18 but the one preceding it - 8.26.17.
I believe this was because of the amount of Abrahamic reference I saw in both translations of the same verse.

> Whether, immortal (AÅ›vins), you rejoice in the water of the firmament, or in the dwelling of the worshipper hear this my (invocation).

(H.H. Wilson)

This reminds me the second day of creation in the KJV of Genesis: 
"And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.
And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day."

Now whether "water of the firmament" refers the water above or below the firmament, I cannot say from reading Wilson. 
However, Griffith uses the word "sea" instead of "water" and that makes the position of the water relative to the firmament quite specific, if we refer to the next two verses of Genesis:
"And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.
And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good."

A sea can only be the water below the firmament, but instead of focusing on one word, if we think about the phrase "sea of heaven", is it really synonymous to "water of the firmament" or is there a different reference?
> Be ye in yonder sea of heaven, or joying in the home of food,
     Listen to me, Immortal Ones.

(T.H. Griffith)

This reminds me of the KJV of opening verse of Revelation 21: "And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea."
In Griffith's translation there is a sea so the heaven in the Rigvedic verse is not "a new heaven". I find this reference beautiful for it reminds us how Rigveda itself is not a new text - it is the oldest Sanskrit text - Sanskrit itself is also not a new language. Another way of thinking is, see how one version reminded me of Genesis, and another of Revelation. One the first book of the Old Testament, another the last book of the New Testament. One reminded by the first translator of Rigveda, another reminded by a later translator. One closer to an older Abrahamic religion - Judaism; another closer to a newer Abrahamic religion - Christianity.
