# My interest in Rigveda, Sanskrit and ancient India
Recently I came across a book called "Metallurgy in India: A Retrospective"; with editors: P. Ramachandra Rao and N.G. Goswami (ISBN: 81-87053-56-7); published in 2001 by NML Jamshedpur. The 8th chapter of this book has the title "India's Contribution to the Mining, Extraction and Refining of Gold: Some Observations Related to the Pre-Christian Era" and was written by R.K. Dube. Under the heading of "Alluvial Placer Deposit" he writes: "The Rgveda (10.75.8) mentions that the river Sindhu (Indus) contains gold..." When I read this, I thought to myself, "Okay, but the verse does not give any hint of alluvial placer deposit. Which part of the river contains this gold? Is the gold buried under the soil under the river?" To answer my question, he then wrote, "In another reference in the Rgveda (8.2.18), it has been mentioned that the path, i.e., both banks, of the river Sindhu contains gold." This made me interested in the book-8 more than any other books of the ancient text. However, when I read the second hymn of the book, I found no such mention as Dube had written. I stopped reading the book right in that second chapter - thinking that some sort of fraudulence was going on to support a claim strongly. 

Who was the fraud? Dube? I am not saying that a professor cannot do something this unethical (or maybe that's what I am saying) but a professor of IIT Kanpur? My study shortly diverged from Rigveda to R.K. Dube. He has a lot of research papers, but I do not think I hold the qualifications to read any academic paper, let alone one written by someone from the Department of Material Science, so my target was some sort of articles, if any written for general audience, by Dube. Truth be told, I could not find any then. 

I started studying about metallurgy with the unrealistic goal to be able to read Dube's research papers someday and that is when I came across a portal called [vedic heritage](https://vedicheritage.gov.in/) initiated under the aegis of Ministry of Culture, Government of India. Guess what I found - a piece of writing that had been published in 2015 in Financial Chronicle - written by Dr. R K Dube!
In the second paragraph of the paper he wrote a line similar to that in that ISBN 81-87053-56-7 book: "Another Rigveda hymn (8.26.18) states that the path of the river Sindhu contains gold, and the word used for it is *hiranyavartanih*." Hymn-26 of the same, my favourite book-8. I checked and yes, it is not a wrong reference. I do not know what happened in ISBN: 81-87053-56-7 - may be some typing mistake? But yes, then I read the whole hymn instead of that one verse, and Rigveda book-8 hymn-26 - a hymn dedicated to the Asvins - became my favourite part of all the Sanskrit texts.

I guess all these started from metallurgy and can you really blame me for going this far - from trying to "expose" a respectable professor (my apologies) to discovering a favourite hymn in a shruti - just for a book about metallurgy? Did you know? H. H. Wilson, the first person to translate Rigveda to English language was attached to the mint at Calcutta, because of his vast knowledge about metallurgy!

## Water of the Firmament - Sea of Heaven
I read two versions of Rigveda 8.26 - one translated by H.H. Wilson and another by T.H. Griffith. One verse interested me more than the others in the hymn; no, not 8.26.18 but the one preceding it - 8.26.17.
I believe this was because of the amount of Abrahamic reference I saw in both translations of the same verse.

> Whether, immortal (Aśvins), you rejoice in the water of the firmament, or in the dwelling of the worshipper hear this my (invocation).

(H.H. Wilson)

This reminds me the second day of creation in the KJV of Genesis: 
"And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.
And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day."

Now whether "water of the firmament" refers the water above or below the firmament, I cannot say from reading Wilson. 
However, Griffith uses the word "sea" instead of "water" and that makes the position of the water relative to the firmament quite specific, if we refer to the next two verses of Genesis:
"And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.
And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good."

A sea can only be the water below the firmament, but instead of focusing on one word, if we think about the phrase "sea of heaven", is it really synonymous to "water of the firmament" or is there a different reference?
> Be ye in yonder sea of heaven, or joying in the home of food,
     Listen to me, Immortal Ones.

(T.H. Griffith)

This reminds me of the KJV of opening verse of Revelation 21: "And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea."
In Griffith's translation there is a sea so the heaven in the Rigvedic verse is not "a new heaven". I find this reference beautiful for it reminds us how Rigveda itself is not a new text - it is the oldest Sanskrit text - Sanskrit itself is also not a new language. Another way of thinking is, see how one version reminded me of Genesis, and another of Revelation. One the first book of the Old Testament, another the last book of the New Testament. One reminded by the first translator of Rigveda, another reminded by a later translator. One closer to an older Abrahamic religion - Judaism; another closer to a newer Abrahamic religion - Christianity.
