- [ProjectAI](https://github.com/ArnobTurja2002Ghosh/ProjectAI)
  - Developed with Threejs (Javascript) in collaboration with [Zawadul](https://github.com/zawadman). We informally named the game in this project - FishFrenz.
  - The game does not contain any GUI: when the game ends, the program crashes, but you can restart the game by simply reloading the browser where you are playing.
  - FishFrenz story: It is a snowy night. Your enemy - the crocodile - is trying to eat your fish friends. The fish are capricious; they take erratic turns in every frame; you can never be sure which direction a fish will be travelling. The voracious enemy targets one of the fish in the water. The truculent crocodile will breach the border of the territory of fish because the direction of the targetted fish is the catalyst that gives the enemy its direction of motion. The enemy thinks that because it is hard to see in snow, let alone at night, it cannot get shot by you, so it will succeed. Only your winning can disabuse the crocodile.
