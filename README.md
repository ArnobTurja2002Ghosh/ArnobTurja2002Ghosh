# How to pronounce my name

Now if you are a Bengali, you have probably already guessed the Bengali transliteration for my name: অর্ণব (yes, that is how I write my name in Bengali).
But since Bengali itself is non-phonetical language, are you sure you know the pronunciation of my name? How much sure?
Sorry, just messing with you, I am pretty sure you know how to pronounce this common Bengali name if you are a Bengali, but you can now probably smell my interest in liguistics and phonetics apart from my interest in Computer Science and here I am going to display this interest by the theme of pronunciation of my name.

There was a sort of controversy about if Bengali language had derived from Sanskrit or if it had only been influenced by Sanskrit alongside many other languages. 
Now, keeping aside the controversy, there is no doubt that my name particularly derived from the Classical Sanskrit word अर्णव "Arnava", which derived from the Vedic Sanskrit word अ॑र्ण॒व "Arnava". 
I know, only the first three English letters of my name matches with the Classical Sanskrit word. Even the number of letters in the two words do not match (5 vs 6).
Therefore, time to break my name into the five letters.

## A
The अ in Devanagari alphabet may look similar to অ in Bengali alphabet, but they are very different in pronunciation.
According to John Beames, "अ is pronounced in Sanskrit and in nearly all the modern Indian languages as a short dull sound similar to the u in English sun, but, or to the a in woman. In Bengali, however, অ has a sound very nearly the same as the short o in English not, rock, top."
Look at the amount of confusion in the very first letter of the name! One particular sound that can be produced from "a", "u" and "o" of the English alphabet!
This is where ISO-15919 gives me the confidence in the spelling of my name - both the अ and অ are romanized to "a" - so I know I am not spelling it illogically to how it is pronounced - this is an international standard of transliteration.

In Vedic Sanskrit, the small vertical line above the letter अ is for the svarita tone. Yes, there are tones in Sanskrit - 4 tones: udatta, anudatta, svarita and dirgha svarita. Vedic Sanskrit usually marks these tones; for example: anudatta is marked by an underline (र्ण॒). If a letter is not marked in Vedic Sanskrit, it has udatta tone.

## R
The র exists in my name in the form of what is called রেফ ref. What I find interesting about ref is that both Beames and Halhed wrote about how র followed by a consonant takes the form of a ref, but none of them mentions the word "ref" even once! Infact Halhed went as far as to calling the ref symbol "arko pholaa" (page 20)! Among my readings, the earliest text that mentions the word "রেফ" ("ref") is Barnaparichay 2nd part by Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar. Interesting but I am not going to any type of conclusion from here and this part needs a bit more research from my side.

## N
Supposed to be a retroflex nasal (ɳ) for the letter ণ but in modern Bengali it is almost always pronounced the same as ন (n) according to the [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengali_alphabet#cite_ref-30) In case anyone, like me, thought from the last sentence that the reluctance of Bengalis towards retroflex is a sign of modernity, according to Schwarzchild, "Retroflex consonants are absent from the other old Indo-European languages, and very early writers therefore thought of these sounds as typically Indian." He further writes, "Discussion has been centred mainly on the problem of the origin of the retroflex consonants: some writers believe that the retroflex consonants are the results of spontaneous phonetic developments, while others, particularly in recent years have favoured the theory of Dravidian influence."

## O
The sound contributed by this letter is called schwa. There was a consonant cluster of "R" and "N" before this. 
In Bengali language a consonant cluster usually follows a close-mid back rounded vowel (o), and my name is no exception.
Just like that the fourth letter of my name failed to match the fourth letter in the transliterated Sanskrit word.

## B
This is the letter that replaces the "va" in "Arnava"; but why is one letter replacing two letters and why "b" instead of "v"?

The answer to the first question is schwa deletion in Indo-Aryan languages. Hindi and Bengali are examples of Indo-Aryan languages.
Although the Devanagari script is used as a standard to write Modern Hindi, the schwa ('ə') implicit in each consonant of the script is "obligatorily deleted" at the end of words and in certain other contexts, unlike in Sanskrit. Since व is at the end of the word, Sanskrit would transliterate my name as "Arnava", but Hindi would transliterate it as "Arnav", resulting in a five-lettered name instead of six. But here's the thing: Hindi would use "v" to show the व because among the 26 letters of the English alphabet, the sound of "v" is the closest to "व". Notice that I said "closest"? That is because English uses voiced labiodental fricative to pronounce "v" and labial velar approximant to pronounce "w", but "व" is between those two sounds:  voiced labiodental approximant (ʋ). 

Now coming to Bengali, the language has a letter that has the sound of ʋ of IPA, but the letter appears twice in the Bengali alphabet, each time denoting a different sound. 
From "A Grammar Of The Bengal Language" by Nathaniel Brassey Halhed, I quote, "ব wo, in the Shanſcrit language is always uſed with the ſound of w; but in the Bengaleſe it is never diſtinguiſhed from ব bo either in form or utterance." That book was written in 18th century, which you could probably guess yourself from the letter "ſ" called "long s", so Halhed did not have access to the IPA devised in the 19th century. So decoding the above quote, by "wo in the Shanſcrit language" he probably meant about व of Sanskrit and ʋ of IPA. By "the Bengaleſe" he must mean about the Bengali language. So he is saying that there are two ব letters in the Bengali alphabet but both are formed and uttered in the same way - uttering the "b" sound. 
Let us see if 19th century could see any change here and here I would like to call John Beames with his "Grammar of the Bengali language literary and colloquial". He writes, "ব representing b (Sanskrit ब), and ব representing ʋ (Sanskrit व) are not distinguished in Bengali. It takes a Bengali boy many years of training before he can pronounce the English ʋ, and many never attain to it. Both as initial and medial ব is in Bengali always b..." (page 9). 

That answers the second question: "b" instead of "v" simply because Bengalis would not be able to pronounce the "v" properly - they would either pronounce the "v" of IPA or go as far as pronouncing "bh".

## Okay, enough of analysis, how do you really pronounce my name?
Honestly, I do not care, because "what's in a name" (look who is saying this after writing the self-obsessed essay above)! But seriously, I think that the Sanskrit word "arṇava", the Hindi word "arṇav" and the Bengali word "ornob" are all equally my name - because such is my love for all these languages. Neither do I oblige a Sanskrit scholar to delete a schwa for me, nor do I expect a Hindi speaker try pronouncing অ (chances are they may ruin it by pronouncing औ) nor do I expect a Bengali speaker to pronounce "ṇ" or "v"; and if you are from any other culture far from these languages, then literally whatever you pronounce is correct, that time it is my responsibility to remember and detect my own name. Just can you do me one favour and not call me أرنب (Arnab)? No, I have no problem with Arabic - I just do not prefer being called ["rabbit"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hq1qrwVnVg) - no I have no problem with rabbits, but many people in Arabic countries eat rabbits. Languages are beautiful - they tell stories. For example Sanskrit is an ancient language; so ancient is the language that some believe it to be the oldest language in the world - some even believe it to be introduced by god Brahma - hence Sanskrit is also called "Dev Vani" (God's words). The oldest known Sanskrit text is Rigveda and hence it interests me more than any other Sanskrit text.

# My interest in Rigveda, Sanskrit and ancient India
Recently I came across a book called "Metallurgy in India: A Retrospective"; with editors: P. Ramachandra Rao and N.G. Goswami (ISBN: 81-87053-56-7); published in 2001 by NML Jamshedpur. The 8th chapter of this book has the title "India's Contribution to the Mining, Extraction and Refining of Gold: Some Observations Related to the Pre-Christian Era" and was written by R.K. Dube. Under the heading of "Alluvial Placer Deposit" he writes: "The Rgveda (10.75.8) mentions that the river Sindhu (Indus) contains gold..." When I read this, I thought to myself, "Okay, but the verse does not give any hint of alluvial placer deposit. Which part of the river contains this gold? Is the gold buried under the soil under the river?" To answer my question, he then wrote, "In another reference in the Rgveda (8.2.18), it has been mentioned that the path, i.e., both banks, of the river Sindhu contains gold." This made me interested in the book-8 more than any other books of the ancient text. However, when I read the second hymn of the book, I found no such mention as Dube had written. I stopped reading the book right in that second chapter - thinking that some sort of fraudulence was going on to support a claim strongly. 

Who was the fraud? Dube? I am not saying that a professor cannot do something this unethical (or maybe that's what I am saying) but a professor of IIT Kanpur? My study shortly diverged from Rigveda to R.K. Dube. He has a lot of research papers, but I do not think I hold the qualifications to read any academic paper, let alone one written by someone from the Department of Material Science, so my target was some sort of articles, if any written for general audience, by Dube. Truth be told, I could not find any then. 

I started studying about metallurgy with the unrealistic goal to be able to read Dube's research papers someday and that is when I came across a portal called [vedic heritage](https://vedicheritage.gov.in/) initiated under the aegis of Ministry of Culture, Government of India. Guess what I found - a piece of writing that had been published in 2015 in Financial Chronicle - written by Dr. R K Dube!
In the second paragraph of the paper he wrote a line similar to that in that ISBN 81-87053-56-7 book: "Another Rigveda hymn (8.26.18) states that the path of the river Sindhu contains gold, and the word used for it is *hiranyavartanih*." Hymn-26 of the same, my favourite book-8. I checked and yes, it is not a wrong reference. I do not know what happened in ISBN: 81-87053-56-7 - may be some typing mistake? But yes, then I read the whole hymn instead of that one verse, and Rigveda book-8 hymn-26 - a hymn dedicated to the Asvins - became my favourite part of all the Sanskrit texts.

I guess all these started from metallurgy and can you really blame me for going this far - from trying to "expose" a respectable professor (my apologies) to discovering a favourite hymn in a shruti - just for a book about metallurgy? Did you know? H. H. Wilson, the first person to translate Rigveda to English language was attached to the mint at Calcutta, just because of his vast knowledge about metallurgy!
